=========== SELECT within SELECT Tutorial ===========
This tutorial looks at how we can use SELECT statements within SELECT statements to perform more complex queries.

1.
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')

2.
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp / population >
(SELECT gdp / population FROM world WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')

3.
SELECT name, continent FROM world
WHERE continent IN 
(SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name IN ('Argentina', 'Australia')) ORDER BY name ASC;

4.
SELECT name, population FROM world
WHERE population >
(SELECT name FROM world WHERE population > 'Canada' AND population < 'Poland')

5.
SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population/(SELECT population FROM world
WHERE name = 'Germany')*100), '%') FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe';

6.
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE gdp > ALL
(SELECT gdp FROM world WHERE gdp > 0 AND continent = 'Europe');

7.
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
(SELECT area FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND y.area>0);

8.
SELECT continent, name FROM world x
WHERE name <= ALL(SELECT name FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent);

9.
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
WHERE continent IN
(SELECT continent FROM world  x
WHERE 25000000 >= (SELECT MAX(population) FROM world y
WHERE x.continent = y.continent));
or
SELECT y.name, y.continent, y.population
FROM world AS y
JOIN
(SELECT continent,max(population) FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING max(population) <= 25000000) AS x
ON y.continent = x.continent

10.
SELECT name, continent FROM world x
WHERE population > ALL(SELECT 3*population FROM world y WHERE x.continent = y.continent AND x.name <> y.name)

QUIZZ 4

1.
SELECT region, name, population FROM bbc x WHERE population <= ALL (SELECT population FROM bbc y WHERE y.region=x.region AND population>0)

2.
SELECT name,region,population FROM bbc x WHERE 50000 < ALL (SELECT population FROM bbc y WHERE x.region=y.region AND y.population>0)

3.
SELECT name, region FROM bbc x
 WHERE population < ALL (SELECT population/3 FROM bbc y WHERE y.region = x.region AND y.name != x.name)

4.
Table-D
France
Germany
Russia
Turkey

5.
SELECT name FROM bbc
 WHERE gdp > (SELECT MAX(gdp) FROM bbc WHERE region = 'Africa')

6.
SELECT name FROM bbc
 WHERE population < (SELECT population FROM bbc WHERE name='Russia')
   AND population > (SELECT population FROM bbc WHERE name='Denmark')

7.

=========== SUM and COUNT ===========
his tutorial is about aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM and AVG. 
An aggregate function takes many values and delivers just one value. 
For example the function SUM would aggregate the values 2, 4 and 5 to deliver the single value 11.

1.
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world;

2.
SELECT DISTINCT(continent)
FROM world;

3.
SELECT SUM(gdp)
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Africa';

4.
SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE area >= 1000000;

5.
SELECT SUM(population)
FROM world
WHERE name IN ('Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania');

6.
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
GROUP BY(continent);

7.
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
FROM world
WHERE population >= 10000000
GROUP BY continent;

8.
SELECT continent
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING SUM(population) >= 100000000;

QUIZZ 5

1.
 SELECT SUM(population) FROM bbc WHERE region = 'Europe'

2.
 SELECT COUNT(name) FROM bbc WHERE population < 150000

3.
AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM()

4.
No result due to invalid use of the WHERE function

5.
 SELECT AVG(population) FROM bbc WHERE name IN ('Poland', 'Germany', 'Denmark')

6.
 SELECT region, SUM(population)/SUM(area) AS density FROM bbc GROUP BY region

7.
 SELECT name, population/area AS density FROM bbc WHERE population = (SELECT MAX(population) FROM bbc)

8.

Americas	732240
Middle East	13403102
South America	17740392
South Asia	9437710



=========== The JOIN operation ===========
This tutorial introduces JOIN which allows you to use data from two or more tables.

1.
SELECT matchid, player
FROM goal
WHERE teamid = 'GER';

2.
SELECT id, stadium, team1, team2
  FROM game
WHERE id = 1012

3.
SELECT player, teamid, stadium, mdate
FROM game JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
WHERE teamid = 'GER'

4.
SELECT team1, team2, player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%';

5.
SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
  FROM goal JOIN eteam ON teamid = id
 WHERE gtime <= 10

6.
SELECT mdate, teamname
FROM game JOIN eteam ON team1 = eteam.id
WHERE coach = 'Fernando Santos'

SELECT player
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
WHERE stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

8.
SELECT DISTINCT player
FROM game JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
WHERE (team1 = 'GER' OR team2 = 'GER') AND teamid != 'GER'

9.

FROM game JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
GROUP BY stadium

11.
SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*)
FROM game JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
WHERE team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL'
GROUP BY matchid

12.
SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*)
FROM game JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
WHERE teamid = 'GER'
GROUP BY matchid

13.
SELECT mdate, 
	   team1, 
	   SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score1, 
	   team2, 
	   SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score2 FROM
	game LEFT JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
	GROUP BY id
	ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
